          "descripcion": "This project is a learning-enabled chatbot designed for efficient and personalized interactions. It utilizes an SQL database to store questions and answers, an Express.js API to handle requests, and an Angular frontend for the user interface. <br /><br />The chatbot can respond to a variety of predefined questions stored in the database. At the beginning of the conversation, it presents the questions it can answer. If asked a question it doesn't know, it informs the user that it cannot provide an answer. Conversely, if it recognizes the question, it returns the associated answer. <br /><br />A key feature is the user's ability to rate the quality of the response. If the user finds the answer unsatisfactory, they can indicate 'I don't like that answer.' The chatbot apologizes and asks the user to provide a better response. Once provided, it updates the database to offer improved responses in the future. <br /><br />Additionally, the chatbot allows users to teach it new questions. When the user says, 'I want to teach you a question', the chatbot requests the new question and its answer. After receiving the information, it saves the question and becomes capable of answering it in future interactions. <br /><br /> If the user wants to know the questions the chatbot can answer, they can ask, 'Which questions can you answer?' and the chatbot will provide a detailed list of the questions it knows.<br /><br />it is important to note that the chatbot works only in Spanish.",
